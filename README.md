csvkit.js
=========

An experimental pure-Javascript CSV reader/writer library initially based on Pavel Kolesnikov's [ya-csv](https://github.com/koles/ya-csv) for Node.js.

The goal of this project is produce a robust, performant and non-Regex-based CSV parser for Javascript that will alleviate the need to constantly transform spreadsheets into JSON for use on the web.

**This code is in use in production at NPR, but you should evaulate the open issues before using it. It has not been thoroughly tested against all varieties of CSV.**
